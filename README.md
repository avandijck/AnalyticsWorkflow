 This file is part of my business value proposition. My propisition consists of developing a linear regression model to show what factors constitute a wine with a high expert rating. The full datasets were obtained from http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/. 
 
 This analysis consists of using the wine data to build a simple linear regression model to predict wine quality based on psychochemical factors. I have documented all the code throughout the analysis and placed the code into small chunks so that it is easy to decipher and follow.
